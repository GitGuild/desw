# Shared Wallet

A shared wallet server, for maintaining a centralized ledger of accounts. Accounts can transfer amounts to each other, deposit and withdraw.

# Plugins

This package is practically useless without installing one or more wallet plugins. The only wallet backend that it comes with is a mockup. Currently supported plugins are: `desw-bitcoin` and `desw-dash`
